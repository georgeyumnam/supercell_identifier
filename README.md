# supercell_identifier

## This repository constain scripts to identify supercell dimensions
## which are best suitable for phonon calculations.

This repository contains the following scripts :
[1] supercell_dim_identifier.py
This employs an Least common multiple approach

[2] supercell_dim_identifier_2.py
This employs a sort and increment of least supercell lattice dimensions
